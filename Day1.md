**Tinker Cad**<br>


Tinkercad is a free, web-based 3D modeling software developed by Autodesk, designed for beginners to create and print 3D models. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily drag and drop shapes to create objects, as well as modify and combine them to create more complex designs. 

Tinkercad also provides a wide range of tools and features, including measurement tools, alignment tools, and shape generators, which can be used to create more intricate designs. Additionally, the software allows users to import and export files in various formats, making it compatible with other 3D design software and 3D printers. 

Overall, Tinkercad is a great option for anyone who is new to 3D modeling or wants to quickly create and print 3D objects without having to learn complex software.<br>
